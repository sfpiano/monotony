*monotony.txt*  Plugin for automating monotonous coding tasks

Commands:
:Fnsort {c/h}
  Alphabetically sorts functions declared in a header file (h) or in a source
  file (c). Note that the plugin will not handle intermixed functions within a
  header. For this to work the source functions must be split by:
    //-----
    //-----
  while the header functions must be split with doxygen-style blocks.

:Fnformat
  Reformats lines exceeding 80 characters

:GSComment {range}
  Automatically populates a doxygen comment block for a get/set function.
  Currently only handles up to one function argument. Select the function with
  visual mode (including the empty doxygen block).
